    <h1>Hi, my name is Ryan</h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>With experience building dynamic user interfaces and architecting scalable web applications, I specialize in
        innovative and reliable software solutions. I collaborate with exceptional teams to deliver ambitious and
        accessible projects—the more challenging, the better.</p>
    <p>My journey began in my freshman year of high school when I picked up an old copy of "C++ Primer." Quickly
        I stumbled into the world of coding and software development. From single-page web
        applications and server-side code to experiments with web and native OpenGL—even writing embedded code to
        control the pumps in my reef tank—I've been passionately tinkering ever since.</p>
